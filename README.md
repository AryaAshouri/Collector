      Discord bot
  </h1>
</a>

<p align="justify">
This is my discord bot which has a really good option and that's nothing except checking the opening of schools in Iran as I mentioned in the description. You can use this source code to see if schools are going to be held or not (I didn't know which pollution index is not suitable for teenagers so I decided to set It 150 in the program). But they are some steps that you should do, so you can use this option in your own bot. Also you can join my server If you want which contains my main bot. It has more options than these which is way more powerful than this 30-40 lines of code for this repository!

## Web Scraping ###
<p align="justify">
Actually, Web scraping is often the only way we can access data. There is a lot of information out there that isn’t available in convenient CSV exports or easy-to-connect APIs. And websites themselves are often valuable sources of data, for example the kinds of analysis you could do if you could download every post on a web forum. But many websites with useful data don’t offer these convenient options. Consider, for example the National Weather Service’s website. It contains up-to-date weather forecasts for every location in the US, but that weather data isn’t accessible as a CSV or via API. As previously mentioned, It’s possible to do web scraping with many programming languages. However, one of the most popular and most interesting approaches is to use Python and the BeautifulSoup library.

## Sqlite Benefits ###
<p align="justify">
SQLite is a very popular database which has been successfully used with on disk file format for desktop applications like version control systems, financial analysis tools, media cataloging and editing suites, CAD packages, record keeping programs etc. There are a lot of advantages to use SQLite as an application file format. SQLite is a very light weighted database so, it is easy to use it as an embedded software with devices like televisions, Mobile phones, cameras, home electronic devices, etc. SQLite database is accessible through a wide variety of third-party tools. SQLite database's content is more likely to be recoverable if it has been lost. Data lives longer than code. It updates your content continuously so, little or no work is lost in a case of power failure or crash. SQLite is less bugs prone rather than custom written file I/O codes. SQLite queries are smaller than equivalent procedural codes so, chances of bugs are minimal.
